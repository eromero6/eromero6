# Hi, I'm Eva Romero! 👋

I’m a senior at the University of Notre Dame majoring in Economics with minors in Accountancy and Data Science. I’ve built my academic path around rigor, curiosity, and a commitment to solving real-world problems with data.

## About Me
- 📊 Research Operations Intern at the Wilson Sheehan Lab for Economic Opportunities​
- 📓 Current courses: Introduction to Data Science, Elements of Computing II, Generative AI in the Wild, Empirical Methods in Development Economics
- 👩🏻‍🎓 Seeking full-time roles in Economic Consulting, Data Analytics, and related areas that allow me to contribute to meaningful data-driven work.
- 💼 Applied research and data analysis experience supporting evidence-based decisions, complemented by operations and leadership experience across team, project, and logistics management.

## Current Projects:
Throughout this semester I will create a portfolio of data-driven web applications, integrating EDA, machine learning models, and LLMs to solve practical problems and effectively communicate results.

- [Elements of Computing II Portfolio](https://github.com/eromero6/ROMERO-elements-of-computing-ii)

## Goals for Spring 2026: 
By the end of the semester I hope to: 
- Build proficiency in using data science tools including Python Libraries (Pandas & Seaborn), Plotly, Streamlit, and SQL for data manipulation, visualization, application development, and database integration.
- Learn core machine learning concepts, including model selection, feature engineering, hyperparameter tuning, and model evaluation, and apply these skills to real-world data.
- Gain exposure to advanced topics like neural networks, natural language processing (NLP), and fine-tuning pre-trained LLMs for analytics and decision-making.
- Proficiently evaluate ethical considerations, such as bias and fairness in datasets, responsible research design, and ethical implications of deploying predictive and generative models.
